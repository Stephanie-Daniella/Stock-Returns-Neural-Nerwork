# Stock-Returns-Neural-Nerwork
Neural Network to predict returns of technology companies.

In this project, a neural network is designed to predict the trends of an asset using the returns from the previous 15 periods. This approach is similar to a moving average, but aims to be more precise by developing a more robust model rather than simply calculating averages.
